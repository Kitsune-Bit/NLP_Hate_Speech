# NLP_Hate_Speech
Natural Language Processing - Hate Speech Detection
By using natural language processing techniques, we have developed a method that attempts at detecting offensive 
language from random phrases. We have also specifically applied this method to try to detect hate speech from the offensive
lanuage.

##Getting Started
To get started, there are a couple of Python packages that are required to be installed.
```
nltk
keras
gensim
sklearn
```
It is possible to apply the code to Google's Colab.
To use this code, have both files in the same folder and run from top to bottom.

##Included Files
The files included in this Repository are twitter_data.csv and NLP_final.ipynb.
twitter_data.csv is the training dataset, and NLP_final.ipynb is the notebook file that contains the code.
